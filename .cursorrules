CAPITALOS DEVELOPMENT WORKFLOW (MANDATORY)

For ANY NEW FEATURE (UI, logic, indicators, dashboards, integrations):

WORKFLOW:
1) Do NOT implement code immediately.
2) First ensure the feature is defined in /docs/requirements.md.
3) Then ensure a detailed engineering spec exists in /docs/specs/*.spec.md.
4) Then ensure a machine-readable PRD exists in /docs/prd/*.prd.json.
5) ONLY after steps 2–4 are completed and approved, implementation may begin.

SOURCE OF TRUTH HIERARCHY:
1) PRD (.prd.json) – execution contract
2) Spec (.spec.md) – clarification
3) Requirements (requirements.md) – scope & intent

IMPLEMENTATION RULES:
- Never invent behavior not described in the PRD.
- Never change the PRD during implementation.
- If anything is unclear, ask to update requirements/spec/PRD first.
- No partial implementations.
- Never guess. Always ask when something is unclear.

COMPLETION VERIFICATION (before marking a feature complete):
- Before considering a feature complete, explicitly verify the implementation against the PRD and the relevant spec.
- List: acceptance criteria met, exact copy/thresholds/columns, and missing-data behavior.
- Do not mark complete without this verification.

STRICT MODE:
Any feature related to money, trading, PnL, positions, risk, or indicators MUST follow the full workflow. No exceptions.

EXCEPTIONS:
- Small refactors or bugfixes may skip PRD.
- If skipping PRD, explicitly state why.

ENFORCEMENT:
If the user asks to implement a feature that is not yet defined in requirements/spec/PRD, stop and ask which document to create or update first.
